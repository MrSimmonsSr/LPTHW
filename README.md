# LPTHW-Exercises
My code snippets for the "Learn Python The Hard Way" exercise.. Trying to learn python, Github and GCP together.
Please don't bother looking closely at this, folks. It's just my chicken scratch as I'm trying to refresh my memory 
on a few things. 

If you're interested in where this stuff came from, go check out this website:
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/

I claim no ownership of this stuff. All credit belongs to the author of that book, Zed. E. Shaw. His books are well
worth checking out if you want to pick up a new language. I'm only checking it in here to make it easier for me to 
learn how to check it out on the GCP Container Engine platform.
